# expenses-calculator
A simple form to calculate shared expenses between two people.

## About
A tool I made to easily divide me and my partner's shared monthly expenses. I expect to save about 90 seconds worth of time each month. 
Designed to divide all inputted values by two and sum to one total. 

Repo includes:
- An HTML file
- A CSS file
- A JavaScript file

This isn't hosted anywhere aside from this repo, so if you want to check it out, you'll have to download the files and open the index.html file in your browser of choice.

## Plans for future updates
Nothing substantial. I'd like to add some custom CSS classes to clean up the mess of colors in the CSS. I'll also add some comments and restructure the whole thing so it's not so disorganized. 

I'd also like to "gussy" up the CSS a little bit. The linear gradient for the background isn't exactly how I'd like it to be, and I've some "visual flare" I'd like to add later down the line.
For now, it's functional and not *too* ugly.
